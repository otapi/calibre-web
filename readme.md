# About

This is a customized fork of the [Calibre-Web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) aimed to my own usage.

## Extra Features

- [ ] A new layout page for a shelf: a very basic simple layout with direct buttons for downloads. This is useful to download selected books of shelves to e-book reader devices (like Kobo) where the standard Calibre menu and scrolling pages with pictures is quite broken. The new page can be reached via button link 'Download' from the specific shelf's page:
download-shelf

- [ ] Fix Guest user's settings. 

- [ ] Even a Guest user can add books to public shelves.

- [ ] Full size cover image at details on mobile

- [ ] Possibility to make a subdomain. E.g. to reach the Calibre-Web via url like books.hostname
